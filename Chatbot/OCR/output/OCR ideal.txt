wrong what wete not getting_and to discount the posi
tive_all that's going right, all that we haw been given -is
surely one of the most pernicious habits of thehuman mind
If we watch our mind at work; we can readily see how mud

There is
2 meal chant from the Zen Buddhist tradition
that begins, "Seventy-two labors brought us this rice, we
should know how it comes [0 us.
Similarly seventy-two
labors have brought us everything we have; for We live in a
network of human interconnectedness that supports our
existence in every way Even though life may not give us
everything we want and contains all sorts of shocks and dis-
appointments; everything that comes along can be a gift  by
helpingus wake up develop new strength and resources, and
become more loving human beings: In that sense, life is stil

fections of relative love
and looks for someone to blame:
Gratitude recognizes what is here -the simple beauty of
Jhuman presence and contact
and responds to it with appre-
kiation, When we reflect on how our life is possible only be:
pause it is held, surrounded, and nourished by a field of
xindness, this gives rise t0 natural gratitude
